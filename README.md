#**Sort Large CSV file**

This is a program using external sort to sort a large csv file that can't fit on RAM._
The file used in code can download here:_
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews _
For other file change: "fname" line 41, "outputFileName" line 252, "outputFile" line 254._
**_Note:_ Leave your disk drive at least twice the original file size (for split file and sorted file)** _
I think that's all feel free to use :)
