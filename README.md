# **Sort Large CSV file**

This is a program using External Sort to sort a large csv file that can't be processed on limited RAM. <br />
The file used in the code can download here: <br />

For other files, you can use this program by changing "fname" in line 41, "outputFileName" in line 252, "outputFile" in line 254. <br />
**_Note:_ Leave your disk drive at least twice the original file size (for split file and sorted file)** <br />
I think that's all feel free to use :)
